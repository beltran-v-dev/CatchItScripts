# CatchItScripts

Catch It! is an online video game PVP. You can choose between two teams: the
dog team or the cat team. The main objective is to pick up the item you'll see at the
opposing team's base and bring it to your base. To win, you should steal their item and
bring it to your base 3 times. If you want to prevent your opponent from picking up your
item, you can shoot them and try to kill them.

In this repository  you'll find the scripts used to make the game
