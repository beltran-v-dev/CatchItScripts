# CatchItScripts

Catch It! is an online video game PVP. You can choose between two teams: the
dog team or the cat team. The main objective is to pick up the item you'll see at the
opposing team's base and bring it to your base. To win, you should steal their item and
bring it to your base 3 times. If you want to prevent your opponent from picking up your
item, you can shoot them and try to kill them.

In this repository  you'll find the scripts used to make the game 

My Tasks: This project was done by 3 people; I was the project manager and one of the
programmers. As a project manager, I managed Trello, sprints, milestones, and the
communication between team members. As a programmer, my main task was to
implement the logic of making the video game online.
